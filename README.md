# Gaussian Elimination Solver

## Overview

The Gaussian Elimination Solver is a C# application that solves systems of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method. The application determines whether the system has no solution, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions. If a unique solution exists, it returns the solution.

## Features

- **Solve Linear Equations**: Uses the Gaussian elimination algorithm to solve a system of linear equations.
- **Detect Solutions**:
  - Checks if the system has **no solution**.
  - Identifies if the system has **one unique solution**.
  - Determines if the system has **infinitely many solutions**.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Clearly displays the result based on the type of solution.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework (version required)
- Visual Studio (or another IDE for C# development)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WahbMohamed2/Gaussian_Elimination_Solver.git
